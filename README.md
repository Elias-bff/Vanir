Vanir is an engine similar to Love2D and related engines, however, it is more structured and crafted for the general experience. Providing a huge vanity of features and modules with customization and comfort in mind.

## Getting Started

- will be done momentarily

## What Sets Us Apart

- **Complete control:** Operate how you want to, open as many windows as you want - or render millions of objects, it's your code.
- **No embedding:** Nothing on the base install is embedded, everything is done from scratch in C, and everything is made for C and extended to Lua for easier module development.
- **Mobile:** A single dll needed, move and require as you wish.
- **Personality:** No pure bindings to be seen, everything has a theme and just makes sense.
- **Community first:** Made a request? You **will** be listened to, and your request **will** be completed.

## Acknowledgements

Vanir is a heavily inspired project to [Starfall](https://github.com/thegrb93/StarfallEx/tree/master), a mod on Garry's Mod. Many of the functions or objects can be seen both in Starfall and in Vanir.
