hooks
    -> hooks that require specifc stacks -> temp solution: manual run function exposed
    -> add function support for callbacks (just didnt get around to it yet)
    -> add error checks to callback functions
-> optimize running hooks to only run when needed
-> convert to using luajit after recode
-> make colored logs later

windows
    -> default window in replacement of null maybe?

dll export->main
    -> load preload
    -> register modules (pre-defined)
        -> init functions triggered

-> window.c init
-> input.c init
-> hooks.c init
    -> add -> addHook(c function)
        lua func ^
    -> run -> runHook(c function)
        -> c function <- hook struct c func
        -> hook function <- hook struct lua func
            -> push c function results
            -> call
                error -> print & pop
