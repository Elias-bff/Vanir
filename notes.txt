high:
    -> finish adding opengl functions to everything, like textured squares etc
    -> shaders.
    -> documentation site both js and static
    -> update the README.md mf
mid:
    -> add viewporting and other matrix opengl functions
    -> add per-vertex callbacks to the rest of the opengl functions (see drawCircle and etc)
    -> finish attaching hooks to internal states
    -> audio
    -> debug stuff (displaying lua stack, etc)
    -> custom user defined hook instances
    -> see if theres a way to detect loops and run hook.run automantically instead of manual
    -> memory accessing
    -> add classes to lua via c
    -> windowless rendering via opengl (maybe via renderoffscreen hook?)
    -> easy 3d stuff, like rendertargets, skyboxes, and matrixes
    -> play testing
    -> threading (optional, plenty of modules already do it)
    -> filesystem and fonts
low:
    hooks
        -> add function support for callbacks (maybe supported already)
        -> add userdata support
    windows
        -> add changing icon, moving, title, etc
        -> add easy window docking
        -> transparency
    system
        -> add all settings from display settings
    render
        -> layering for hooks and related (predrawopaque, postdrawtranslucent, etc)
    -> colored logs and related like alignment
    -> message boxes and related functions
    -> meshes, joints, and rigbodys (seperate when started work)
    -> physics (should be done last)
    -> maybe a lua based shader language? likely compiled
    -> add timers to timers.c (currently only returns time)
    -> support all platforms (will likely be done soon)
    -> add user based functions such as returning user's name and settings
    -> add internal variables to lua that indicate platform and related
    -> optional config, perhaps using preload.lua
    -> http stuff, will likely just use a premade library
    -> vr?
    -> streaming
    -> vectors, localToWorld, and related
    -> websockets, joysticks, touch, and binary related stuff
    -> data encoding/decoding stuff, maybe add json
